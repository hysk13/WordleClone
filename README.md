# WordleClone
"A Copy of Famous Game Wordle"
I decided to do a small React project and cloned the famous game by New York Times: Wordle. https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html
Some of my friends and I were addicted to Wordle once, and I thought Wordle Clone would be a nice project to get me started with React.
Still feels writing README.md tbh :/

## Built With
- HTML CSS      (Obviously) | Pure HTML CSS
- JavaScript    (Obviously) | React JavaScript

## Trying Things Out
I can probably try and host this on GitHub pages... but I won't (because lazy).
You can always try forking this repository and running it on your machine. "It WoRkEd On My MaChInE".
If you have issues, please report.

> npm install
> npm run dev

## Usage?
You can use this project if you want, but I can't see how you will use it...
Again, I don't think I'll care. You can do whatever you want.
